<p>Welcome to DS2!  That stands for Defense Support Services - it's where I work.</p>
<p>I'm an Avionics Technician and I wanted to show you how crazy it can get at my work.  Everything will seem to be fine until the helicopters come in at the end of the day - which is the end of your shift.</p>
<p>We'll go around what usually happens at the end of the day - most fridays as a matter of fact.</p>
