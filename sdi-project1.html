<p>This story takes place at a skate park.  You encounter a skatepark attendant who asseses you to determine the proper area for you to skate..</p>
<p>The reason I chose this story is that when I broke my leg I was 27 years old and trying to do the half pipe for the first time ever.  If I would've had a person there to let me know I probably didn't have enough experience to be doing this I might not have broken my leg.</p>
